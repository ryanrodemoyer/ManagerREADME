# Using Trello to Increase Productivity and Reduce Anxiety

I've been increasingly busy at work with multiple projects needing attention both as a contributor and manager. This lead to increasing amounts of anxiety and frustration where constantly I feel busy all day long yet I'm not making any progress towards my day-to-day tasks.

Trello is a great tool to keep track of and manage tasks. The tool is simple and effective with a UI that does exactly as much as you need. You can find it at https://trello.com and has a super functional free-tier.

The main idea behind Trello is to create a "board" that groups together a collection of "cards" (i.e. tasks) using a common theme. A board consists of one or more lists and each list consists of one or more cards. A card might be best compared to a Post It note that allows me to capture a high level idea or thought and optionally a few details. Trello gives me a simple and effective strategy to manage my day-to-day tasks at work. 

I created a board in Trello to serve as my giant to-do list for work. My board consists of five lists: To Do, Doing, Done, Blocked and Skipped. I feel my descriptions are going to be fairly self-explanatory.

To Do is the list I use to track anything incoming that I need to remember and in priority order. This can be anything from an email I need to send, a follow up from a meeting or something asked of me from a coworker. Basically, I create a card for tasks I'm working on throughout the day. Rarely do I input task details or add comments. Perhaps an accurate description of when to create a card is anything I need to remember to do in the future or something that's going to take me more than thirty minutes.

To Do is super powerful with getting me to deal with those tasks that have been put off or sound not very fun. The card is in the list and I need it finished as soon as possible so I can stop thinking about it. Now I’m giving myself the power to create a plan or course of action to deal with it and get the card moved to Done.

Doing is the list for when I start working on anything from To Do. Move the card to Doing once I commence work on the task. It might sit here for five minutes or five days. The point is that I have a list of items I am currently working on and making progress. The perk is that I have an accurate list of what to work on when I have free time available or ready to switch tasks.

Important note: To Do and Doing are organized by priority with the most important tasks at the top of the list. This gives me a powerful visual indicator of what I should try to finish quickly or what task to take next.

Done is the list for when the work is finished. Super easy. Move the card to Done when the work is finished. It's like tossing your worry in the trash can. Bonus is that you can look back on all the cool things that have been accomplished to-date.

Blocked is the list I use when I am unable to make any more progress on an item without getting assistance from someone or something else. Work diligently to get items out of Blocked as quickly as possible.

Skipped is when I needed to do something but no longer need to complete. Skipped means no more time should be put towards this effort. Feel free to move an item from Skipped back to To Do or Doing but really you should put items in Skipped only when absolutely sure that the item is no longer valid.

Rather quickly will the Done list fill up list of finished tasks so feel free to use the Archive feature to keep a task on a list but remove it from the main view. Trello even has a cool set of add-ons called Power-Ups that extend Trello beyond the standard feature set.

Perhaps you’ve had similar feelings of being overwhelmed and if so, then maybe this will be an effective strategy to remedy those negative thoughts. Hopefully you found this helpful. Feel free to message me with follow-ups or other questions/thoughts/comments/concerns/jokes/trivia/etc.
